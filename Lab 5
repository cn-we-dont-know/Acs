Experiment 5:

Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack

Ensure Wireshark is installed on the Kali machine.
Ensure ettercap is installed on kali machine

On windows machine: give ipconfig and check the ip and gateway address
In attacker machine ( Kali Linux) , give ifconfig and check the ip address

1. Open ettercap tool in kali linux. In setup, start sniffing and click the tick mark.
2. Scan for hosts and click on host list to see the hosts in the network
3. Identify the target and the gateway ip to perform MITM attack OR You can also 
perform MITM attack for all hosts.
For all hosts, default attack, select MITM and then select ARP poisoning

For all hosts, default attack, select MITM and then select ARP poisoning 
Then, select sniff remote connections and click OK
4. Now in the victim or target host, Open vulnerable web 
5. Ettercap intercepts the traffic and will capture all the network traffic which come 
from target device to gateway. The below output shows how ettercap captures 
traffic.


MANUAL ATTACK:
Step 1: Open three terminals and login to super user in all three terminals

echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --destination-port 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 10000

in 2nd terminal
type
arpspoof -t [Victim_IP] [Gateway_IP]

in 3rd terminal
type
arpspoof -t [Gateway_IP] [Victim_IP]

open wireshark and start capturing packets and after give enter in 2 terminals command untill dont give press enter

Step 6: Now open web browser in target or victim host and open any vulnerable website altoro mutual
and login with username and password to the portal

Step 7: In attacker host ( kali Linux) , stop capture and serach for POST HTTP header 
packet.
Step 8: Open the post header and observe whether the login credentials are captured
