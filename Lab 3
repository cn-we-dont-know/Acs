File Upload Vulnerabilities: 

select upload
Attempting a Malicious PHP File Upload:

o Create a simple PHP file that outputs “Hello” to test if server-side scripting can be 

executed:

php

<?php echo "Hello from your PHP file!"; ?>

o Save this file as test.php



Upload the Malicious PHP File:

o Attempt to upload test.php in the File Upload module.

o Expected Result: At the Low security level, DVWA may accept the PHP file and 

provide a link to access it.

4. Access the Uploaded PHP File:

o Click on the link or navigate to the file path displayed after upload (e.g., 

http://metasploitable_IP/dvwa/hackable/uploads/test.php).
